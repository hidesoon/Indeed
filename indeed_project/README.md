What is this! What does it all mean? 

This directory is pretty fresh still, right now all we have in here is the core of a Django backend for storing the extracted data, an ad hoc database structure and there's a little robot to automate the extraction and storage process with the ability to send an email after its job is done. After some analyses are done there'll be more helpful words and bootful pictures, I promise.
